### Introduction 
The quality of green products and agricultural productivity are at risk from plant leaf diseases. The most important factor leading to the reduction of grapes is grape disease. Therefore, a method for the identification of grape leaf diseases needs to be developed. Diseases of the grape plant begin at the leaf and then spread to the stem, fruit, and root. Due to limited access to human experts in developing countries, it is difficult for farmers in remote areas to classify grape leaf diseases due to time constraints and lack of knowledge.
