## ‚òò Introduction 
The quality of green products and agricultural productivity are at risk from plant leaf diseases. The most important factor leading to the reduction of grapes is grape disease. Therefore, a method for identifying grape leaf diseases needs to be developed. Conditions of the grape plant begin at the leaf and then spread to the stem, fruit, and root. Due to limited access to human experts in developing countries, it is difficult for farmers in remote areas to classify grape leaf diseases due to time constraints and lack of knowledge.

## üçÉ Objective
* To develop a trustworthy grape leaf detection system capable of reliably identifying and categorizing various forms of grape leaf diseases in real time.
* Using deep learning approaches, create systems that can detect and categorize grape leaf disease automatically.

## üå± Motivation
* Grape leaf diseases are a major issue for farmers all over the world. They have the potential to harm grape vines, resulting in significant financial losses for farmers.
* Furthermore, grape production is being curtailed. However, thanks to advancements in technology, we now have automated devices that can identify grape leaf disease in real-time. As a result, these cutting-edge deep-learning algorithms will be used to create an accurate grape disease detection system.

## üìÇ Dataset
Deep learning models require a large dataset to function successfully. Grape leaf photos from two datasets available on Kaggle are collected in this project. The dataset is divided into four classes: one for healthy leaves and three for afflicted grape leaves, such as Black Rot, Esca, and Leaf Blight. Each image has a resolution of 256*256 pixels.
